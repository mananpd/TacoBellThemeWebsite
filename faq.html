                        is being prepared. Participation is encouraged, but not mandatory if you're deep in a food-coma prep.

                        Yes. Gidget's spirit is strong here. Whether it's a ghostly "Yo Quiero Taco Bell!" or 
                        a phantom growl, don't be alarmed. It's just her way of saying she approves of your 
                        life choices (especially the ones involving cheese).
