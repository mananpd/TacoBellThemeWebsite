                    Come dressed just as you would for any other fine Taco Bell establishment. Comfort is key, especially
                    when embarking on a culinary journey of this magnitude.

                    pondered our magnificent (and highly customizable) menu, simply approach our state-of-the-art
                    "kiosk" (aka, the very patient person taking your order).

                    Just a friendly heads-up: to preserve the unparalleled integrity of the Bell @ Home flavor profile,
                    we do not allow outside food. Any external culinary contributions will, regrettably, need to be left
                    at the door before entering our sacred space.

                    taco lovers. We've got the food covered; you bring the sips!

                    Our exclusive establishment has taken over the former secret lair of a mysterious local conspiracy group.
                    You can now find us tucked away there... if you know where to look and possess the right level of
                    taco-fueled intuition. We keep a low profile, but the scent of seasoned beef should guide your way.
